# Manhunt Compass Datapack
A datapack version of the player tracking compass used in Dream's *Minecraft Manhunt* series.

## Features
- **Compatible w/ Realms**: Since this is a datapack instead of a plugin, it can be used on a Realm instead of a typical server.
- **Advanced tracking info**: A tracking compass does not need to be held in order for it to work, but holding it displays the name of the current speedrunner and their current y-coordinate in the action bar
- **Works across dimensions**: The tracking compass works in all three Minecraft dimensions. Additionally, if a hunter is not in the same dimension as the speedrunner, the compass will point to the speedrunner's most recently used portal. In this same case, if the hunter holds the compass in their hand for addtional information, the action bar will tell them that the speedrunner is currently in another dimension.
- **Compass on Respawn**: A hunter will be given a new tracking compass on respawn, provided a player is currently being tracked.
